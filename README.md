The embedding part is covered in file embedding.ipynb. If you wish to check the performance of the model, you can either download the pretrained word vectors from Tencent AI Lab and put it under folder ./wordvector/tencent and run embedding.ipynb to generate the word embedding, or directly download our dataset with word embedding and put it under the same folder with model.ipynb.
